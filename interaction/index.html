		  <p>We find interactions everywhere, whether in the real world or the digital one. Just take a look at smartphones or computers: From turning them on to shutting them down, we constantly interact with these devices and, in turn, with the internet. In short, our world wouldn’t be the same without interaction on the web or in the digital space.</p>
		  <p>These interactions don’t necessarily have to be functional or "important" – they can also be playful, informative, or completely useless. While working on the task of creating sketches with different interactions in p5.js, I learned several key points. The goal is to involve the viewer or user in the project in some way. This is achieved through simple and clearly recognizable functions that are intuitive to use.</p>
		  <p>I also realized how closely movement and interaction are connected. One project I particularly want to highlight is my turntable. This small project was by far my favorite. I was fascinated by the possibilities of experimenting with different functions: What happens when? If I press this, does something else stop working? If this moves, can I do that? These logically interconnected functions really captivated me.</p>
		  <p>In conclusion, I can say that I have learned a lot about interactive functions and how to communicate them to the user.</p>
