			<p>In this section of the seminar, we worked with the program p5.js. This language is well-suited for beginners and offers many opportunities to experiment creatively. The principle is quite simple: you create a canvas and can then "paint" on it. At times, it felt like Microsoft Paint but with programming.</p>
			<p>Our task was to use this program to create visual compositions on the theme of perspective. The challenge was to use two-dimensional objects to create a sense of depth and three-dimensionality on the canvas. Additionally, it was interesting to see how static objects could be used to generate movement (e.g., circles that continuously grow in size).</p>
			<p>In this topic, I learned a lot about relative relationships in coding. How can I structure the code so that colors are well-coordinated without having to define each one individually? How should I write the code so that objects scale relatively rather than being based on fixed values? In short, I learned a lot about color theory and responsive web design. These skills proved to be very useful later in the seminar.</p>
