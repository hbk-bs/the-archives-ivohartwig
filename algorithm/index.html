		<section class="REFLECTION">
			<div class="text">
			<p>How can I get someone else to implement my vision of a project? How do I need to articulate myself so that the other person understands me and follows the instructions correctly? I explored these questions in the context of analog algorithms. My goal was to create a hand made of geometric shapes as the final result.</p>
			<p>To achieve this, I wrote instructions and passed them on to my fellow students. I repeated this process until I reached my goal (about seven times). Each time, I had to adjust and specify my instructions further. Throughout the process, I realized that I needed to give clear and precise instructions and explain each step in detail. This is why my instructions became more and more specific over time.</p>
			<p>However, it was very important to me not to neglect the creative aspect. Even though my instructions may seem restrictive, artistic freedom in their execution remained possible.</p>
			<p>This engagement with algorithms in an analog context was a great preparation for programming later on. One must express themselves precisely but also avoid overcomplicating things. Additionally, this process clearly shows that sometimes you need to revise your instructions or your program when things don’t work as expected.</p>
